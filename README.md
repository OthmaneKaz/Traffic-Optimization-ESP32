# Traffic-Optimization-ESP32
## Traffic Optimization of an intersection with traffic lights connected to the cloud via a ESP32

In our country, the majority of cities used basic traffic light systems, i.e. using a stored time </br>
function. Since there is a change in traffic during the day and due to this punctual variation we find </br>
a traffic blockage. In most cases, the police manually adjusts these traffic lights. The main objective </br>
of our project is to make the traffic of a road artery with traffic lights connected to the Internet </br>
network in other words, we modify the waiting time of traffic lights based on data provided by </br>
the Google Maps API. This proposed solution, should avoid or minimize the overfull in the traffic lights </br>
by dynamically modifying the waiting time.
